CTR Prediction is very important component of Advertisment System.

## CTR = ( # Clicks ) / ( # Impressions )

i.e. 

CTR = Total Number of Clicks / Total Number of Impressions. 

Impressions = the number of times an ad has been seen.

Clicks = the number of times an ad has been clicked.



Amonge so many page views users have provided how many ads clicked.

Search Engine like Microsoft (Bing), Google, Yahoo and Amazon, Walmart, Flipkart uses **CTR x Bid** to rank ads because it displays the ad with maximal expected revenue first.

So we have Binary Classification Problem because If user click ads then +ve otherwise -ve if don't click.
